It was meant to be a day of joy,
Yet moisture pools in her eyes.
The one meant to be closest,
Carelessly hurt her so bad.

Long she thought her heart had hardened,
Immune to hate, to love, to feel.
But the armor was mere illusion,
Her tender heart beneath was real.

Kindness, they said, she must possess,
Yet those who preached it turned away.
They claimed divinity was fiction,
But who would mend her heart's dismay?

No harm to others did she wish,
Her soul yearned for distant skies.
To dwell in valleys, calm and serene,
Where sorrow ends and pain subsides.

Yet amidst the turmoil, she finds resilience,
A quiet determination to endure.
She knows her strength will see her through,
For in this quest, that is the meaning of her life.
