End of 2018!

In the blink of an eye, it's 2019, and finally, I'm no longer a student.

When I was young, I eagerly wished to grow up quickly, but now I'm beginning to feel the passage of time.

Recently, I've been reading 'Sophie's World,' and it's truly a wonderful book.

It makes me think about philosophical questions like whether consciousness exists after death more often. I'm increasingly aware of how insignificant one person is; I'm just an ordinary person after all.

What will I be like in 10 years? I'm curious and eager to find out. But in 10 years, I'll be older too.

And what about after that year? I think I'll definitely be living a better life than I am now.

Life always gets better slowly.

Just go with the flow.
